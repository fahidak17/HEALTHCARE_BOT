  <h1>Healthcare Assistant using AI</h1>
  <h3>Oct 2021 - May 2022</h3>
  <p><strong>Associated with:</strong> Prathyusha Engineering College</p>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Healthcare Assistant using AI is an innovative solution designed to help users who are unable to visit hospitals physically but are in need of medical guidance and support. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this system allows users to interact with a chatbot using text or voice inputs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The assistant can understand the userâ€™s symptoms and queries, provide basic suggestions, prescribe preliminary diets or medications, and even connect the user to a physician if necessary. In severe cases, it can guide users to the nearest hospital via navigation or initiate a direct call to a doctor.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Interactive chatbot interface for text and voice-based communication.</li>
    <li>Real-time symptom analysis and response generation.</li>
    <li>Basic prescription and diet recommendations based on user input.</li>
    <li>Escalation to medical professionals when required.</li>
    <li>Navigation assistance to the nearest hospital or doctor.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
  <p>
    The backend uses NLP techniques implemented in Python. Specifically, we utilized <code>TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)</code> and <code>Cosine Similarity</code> algorithms to process and understand user inputs. The chatbot analyzes keywords from the text input, matches them against a pre-trained dataset collected from hospitals and verified medical sources, and generates contextually relevant responses.
  </p>
  <p>
    The frontend was built using HTML and CSS, providing a simple and user-friendly interface for easy interaction. Voice input functionality was integrated to make it accessible for users who may not be comfortable typing.
  </p>

  <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
  <p>
    In future versions, we plan to integrate e-commerce features by collaborating with pharmaceutical stores. This will enable users to purchase medicines and dietary supplements directly through the chatbot. Additionally, there is potential to expand this into a fully functional mobile or web application to reach a wider audience.
  </p>

  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Python (NLP, TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)</li>
    <li>HTML, CSS (Frontend)</li>
    <li>Voice recognition libraries</li>
    <li>Data collection from hospitals and medical sources</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <div class="highlight">
    Our AI-based Healthcare Assistant aims to make medical support more accessible and immediate, especially for users who cannot physically reach healthcare facilities. By combining advanced NLP techniques with a straightforward user interface, we created a system that acts as a first line of support while maintaining the option to escalate to professional medical help when necessary. We are excited to continue evolving this project to include medicine delivery and fully integrated telemedicine services.
